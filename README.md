# SimpleConsole
This is a coding practice example <br>
<br>
Like an artist practice singing, singing an old song in a new way.<br>
<br>
It's an old classical console app that anyone can do.<br>
<br>
Flow: <b>DisplayMenu --> GetValidInputFromConsole --> TakeActionBasedOnInput --> GoBackToMenuOrEnd</b> <br>
<br>
However, the coding style is very different (at least compare to my old self when I started programming)<br>
<br>
The purpose is making it readable, exactly as a sequence of steps in a use case. That is: <br>
<br>
<b>DisplayMenu --> GetValidInputFromConsole --> TakeActionBasedOnInput --> GoBackToMenuOrEnd</b> <br>
<br>
Check it out and have fun
